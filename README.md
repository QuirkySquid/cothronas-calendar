# Cothronas Calendar

A custom calendar module for the weird and wacky cosmology of my homebrew setting of Cothronas. Still fairly early in development!
If this goes well, I might try to make this more modular so that it can work for other worlds, too. But at least for now, this is just a personal project.

## Planned features
- Visual calendar display (done!)
- Sunrise/sunset times for both suns
- Moonrise/moonset and lunar phases (which is weird because two suns)
- Sun/moon visualization
- Weather
- Calendar events
- Player permissions
